	CFOP:   cross->xcross (first pair at FR)
		           xcross
	Roux:	fs->fb->sb->cmll->lse
			    fb->sb->cmll->lse

 -ability to apply moves between blocks (your own algs, etc.)
 -additional hex value to describe centers
 -wide L moves added (l/l2/l')
 -added optimal Roux CMLL and LSE. You can edit the algs in CMLL.txt.
 	Roux:	fs->fb->sb->cmll->lse
			    fb->sb->cmll->lse

 -way to apply solutions (typing number next to it) and continue
 -keeps track of applied move sequences (print command)
 -save applied sequences to text file (don't need to copy manually)
 -added second steps, see below
